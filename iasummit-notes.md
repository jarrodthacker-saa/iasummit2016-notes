# IA Summit 2016 Day 1

## MANAGING DIGITAL GOVERNENCE | Lisa Welchman 

### On being more inclusive in the makerspace

> "Engineer inclusivity into the hearts and bones (of the web)"
  - we're failing at this so far in the maker community

- As much as you're trying to create meaningful experiences for people online, it all looks the same to me (talking about how we deal with identity)

#### It's time to step up
- "I'm not a diversity expert...but when you grow up diverse, you realize you don't know anything." (but) I have set experiences and I want to bring those experiences to the convo
- We need an intentional moral code in our maker community, so what we make will be for everyone
- We control what stories come up and down
- We have to be patient...it takes a while...because we're measuring things in our life spans

#### Problem: A small group of people deciding what problems to solve and stories to tell
- A lot of name calling and public blaming and shaming made worse by the immediacy of digital.
- You're not going to get anywhere until you get somewhere where you can the conversation can keep everyone's dignity.
- Criticism and solutions that focus around organizations instead of individuals are part of the problem.
  - That's a way of deflecting blame to someone else instead of you.

> *I'm not going to argue that institutions don't make a difference, but it's not going to be the thing that helps. (the enforcement). Focus on the people.*
  - Should be our attitude toward accessibility among other things.

### Things we can do to help alleviate this problem

#### Don't believe the hype
- stop validating the myth of the unicorn
- stop letting that be the convo and shift it

#### Do more by doing less
- You may not have all the answers
- Sometimes you just need to listen

## DESIGN IS A TEAM SPORT | Jared Spool,  UIE

- Tyler Thompson wrote a humorous story about a Delta boarding pass and he redesigned it.
- Dustin Curtis ended up on the American Airlines websites and did something similar after seeing how much it sucked.

### Rendering of intent
- Neither of these guys were working under the same constraints as the products' designers.
- You have to take into account the context of the design.
> Ex. - Tyler designed a boarding pass outside of org restraints
  - In order to implement this pass, Delta would have to replaced 10000 board pass printers
  - Change paper size and add cutting for bleeds
  - Created new supply chain for colored ink

### What causes poor design?
- The right intention; poorly rendered?
or
- A poor intention rendered correctly?

> If we improve design, we must work on both the intentions and the skills of rendering

> A great design is thought of as an experience. Not just an activity, but how they work together

- Design process of the aforementioned: "I'm pissed off and I'm going to show you how to do it right"

### An intentionally designed process answers these questions:
- Who is on the design team?
- How will they add value?
- How do we introduce the design process?
- Who will get credit for any successes?
- Who will take the blame for any failures?

> "The most effective design teams worship inclusiveness"

### On how to counteract the expectancy bias
- Our own expectations will cause the outcomes to Change
- If we believe that some people are "expert designers" and others are "not designers", we affect our expectations of those people.
- Our expectations can change our team's outcomes.

- Dana Chisnell worked on a project to convert paper applications to online format (6mil apps a year, 10 pages to 1000 / app, 3000 field personnel have to review)

> - 100 devs
> - 12 tech leads
> - 10 business analysts
> - 6 product managers
> - 2 product owners
> - 1 designer = Dana

- She thinks all 121 people are actually designers.
*The design team consists of any individual who influences the rendering of our intention*
- Product design is no longer about only trained designers

### How do we get them to be good designers?

#### Growth stages of Understanding
  - _Unconscious Incompetence_ – poor outcomes w/o realizing it
    - There's an inflection point (or a place where something changes and you can move to the next phase). They see the diff between good and poor quality
  - _Consciously Incompetent_ – you're aware you suck
    - Learns practices and predictably get good outcomes
  - _Conscious Competence_ – you can produce good outcomes at a good level
   - you know what the rules are. you can use patterns to be consistent
  - _Unconsciously competent_ – comprehensive knowledge and craftsmanship for intuitive work
  (able to ask the right questions no one else asked, then find a soultion no one else could have)
    - intuitively good product quality w/o explicit thought
  
> Dana's challenge was to get 120 people "consciously competent"
  - The mechanism for this is getting to _Consciously Incompetent_, is "literacy"
  - Getting from CI to CC is "fluency"
  - From CC to UC is "mastery"

> Ex. Personas are a horrible literacy play, but may be useful at the fluency/mastery levels
  - They're just a jargon activity that may or may not work

### Engineering Literacy
- She had all 120 of her team members go out into the field and talk and meet the field reps that are processing apps and watch them for a day.
  - after this immersive exposure program, found that they started making better user stories based on observations, not their imaginations
  
> - Cyd Harrell is working with _Code for America_
  - She runs a usability test exercise with an activity to make an origami giraffe (which is coupled with poor instructions) to teach basic usability testing techniques

> - Bill Scott, _Paypal, Project Hermes_
  - Started with Lean UX methodology, they worked on their next generation checkout experience and finished in 10 weeks
  - This was a CC play to improve team fluency

*Each of these examples came to the table with the expectation that ever team member has design potential. You have to think that everyone is a good designer.*

> Embrace "Everyone thinks they're a designer"; help every team member become a better one

## (NOT) DESIGNING FOR OURSELVES: A CASE STUDY FROM THE U.S. WEB DESIGN STANDARDS | Carolyn Dew + Colin MacArthur,  United States Digital Services

- Starts with a story about all the different government sites a user has to go to in order to get info about student loans, showing the danger of design fragmentation in government websites/applications (really anywhere). 
- Some agencies created their own pattern libraries, but there was a need for a more centralized standard
  - Accessibility is often an afterthought in libraries like Bootstrap controlling 

### Impetus behind U.S. Web Design standards 
- We needed a consistent experience across all federal touch-points
> "PLOTUS" = "Pattern Library of the United States"
- Need to componentize things - make them reusable and easier-to-use
- Allowing it to be found, easily accessible

### Reality of designer/dev using a style guide/repo
  1. Find the things 
    - Are we able to locate appropriate patterns
  2. Question its existence
    - Why are we recommending this pattern. Be able to see how it performs in _real-life_
    - Documentation and code being along side it helps validate and explain each other
  3. Try to break it
  4. Get the things
  5. Use the thing

#### Proposition a design guide for the appropriate audiences
- For viz designers, explain visual decisions
- For UX designers, give the reasons and research for your reasons
- For devs, allow multiple way to test out components

*Don't design for yourself, but everyone in your org that will use it*

## REMOTELY AGILE? EFFECTIVE INTERACTION WITH DISTRIBUTED AGILE TEAMS | Dorinne Hammons, Kelsey-Seybold Clinics
In order for Agile to grow, it has to be able to adapt to remoteness

###Some of the biggest pain points for remote Agile
- Working together daily
- face to face conversation
- self-organizing teams

#### Issues
- Hard to read cultural cues remotely
- Status tracking (less important what you're using, just find something that works for you)
- Time zones are a problem

#### Solutions
- Need a good meeting tool
- Establish rules
- Collaboration is difficult because you can't just duck into a room, but its doable.
  - There are tools you can use like Slack, Scribblar, Drawings.
  - Or you can just use screensharing.
> You have to be available to your team, and your team needs to know when best to contact each other
- Making other teams scrum boards visible
- Check out [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/ "Agile Alliance") for more resources.

## THE ARCHITECTURE OF TEACHING AND LEARNING (ATL) | Peter Morville

### Strategies for teaching

- Sometimes discomfort is valuable. Pretesting is uncomfortable, but it might improve retention.

#### Why should I care about being a better teacher?
- We are all teachers. we're teaching all the time, - home, work, confs

### "RIGOR"
> Comes from "Make it Stick" book, except for the "Garnishing" concept
  - To make it "stick", we have to make it difficult. When it's effortful. Recall improves from this, studies have shown.
  
#### Retrieval
- Introducing friction to a learning experience can increase retention of that knowledge as opposed to perceived "easier" circumstances.

#### Interleaving
- Compare and contrast by viewing different examples. 
- Makes it more flexible and difficult. 
- Mixing skills, subjects, problem types. 
- Similar to spaced practice, where you do a little each day.

#### Garnishing
- Explain new material in your own words
- Frame new knowledge in a larger context

#### Organizations
- Organize ideas into mental models.
- Taking what you know and sketching out mental models
> Much like _Information Architecture_: Making the invisible, visible

#### Reflection
_ Thinking about thinking
_ Reflecting on what you did, what worked, how might do differently
_ What we know about what we know, and how we Learning

### Planning
- "Playing, Practicing, and Prototyping, and all part about planning well"
  - So are Risks, estimates, and metrics
  - Plus feedback and reflection
- We get better at planning by making planning visible.
* Intersection between IA and instructional design? Not a lot of working being done there right now*

# IA Summit 2016 Day 2

## IA in Agile | Hannah Grossman, The Nerdery

- The ideology presented through Agile development principles can be interpreted in ways that hinder informed designs
> Ex. The emphasis of "Working Software Over Comprehensive Documentation" preventing big picture ideas (Sprint 0)

- Balancing vision with action is difficult.

### How to make IA and Agile play together more nicely
1. Flexible definitions of agile principles
2. Embracing the unknown
3. Sharing the big picture with others
4. Learning to recognize "good enough" (for now)
5. Not being afraid to rework things.

## PRACTICAL TECHNIQUES FOR ~~FIELD~~ RESEARCH | Brad Munnaly, 18F

### 1. Planning and Prep
  - Validated initial assumptions
  - Cover all necessary topics
  - Help sessions flow more smoothly

#### Parts of a planned research study
  - Test plan
    - Define the project background
    - Overall purpose
  - Recruitment screener
    - Survey
    - User profiles
  - Interview guide
  - Introduction packet
    - Sent in advance to introduce yourself and the project's purpose (include photo and personal info)
  - Travel logistics
    - Map out routes
    - Estimate travel time
    - Plan breaks and meals
    - Avoid over scheduling
  - Observer instructions
    - layout rules so other stakeholder participating will behave as researchers
  - Worksheet to capture notes
    - key for multiple teams
    - helps with synthesis
    
> "If you're testing for anyone, you're not designing for anyone."

#### Formulating Questions take into account:
- goals of research
- team's objectives
- existing assumptions
- general hypothesis

> Ask yourself why you need to ask a question.

#### How to do self-recruiting
- Cold calling
- Live recruiting
- Email 
- Screening surveys

##### Outsourcing Recruitments
- Market research firms
- Online user groups


#### General notes on planning
- In-person research: keep in mind the time available to you.
- Remote research: technology is not your friend. Plan for difficulties and plan to train the user on those remote technologies.
- Test tech before each session
- Basically your first session(s) will be a wash if you don't perform dry runs, so pilot test in some way.

### 2. Field Research
- Small talk matters, do it
  - Sets a friendly and relaxed tone (questions about background, personal questions, questions about immediate environment, commonalities)

#### Managing flow
- *Peaks* - Areas of conversation that are more sensitive, or heated - high impact
- *Valleys* - Areas of conversation that are more low impact

You want to strike a balance and flow between low and high points of the conversation.

##### Order of questions
- Simple/basic questions
- Topic-based questions
- Sensitive Areas (you work yourself up to this)

#### Observing participant responses
- Focus on their behavior -- verbal and body language

##### Avoidance patterns
- Closed language (short responses, closed arms, etc)
- Changing the subject

### 3. Finding Patterns
> When analyzing qualitative data, you're trying to find the story.

1. Identify what is a datapoint
2. Pulling out data points
  - Try writing data points on post-its and peppering them on a wall to make them more tangible. Group to find patterns. This helps avoid biases that you might have when making straight assumptions from data sets.

### 4. So what?
> Actionable data begets new frontiers, new problems, new solutions

## CRAFTING THE DISCOVERY PHASE: FIRST STEPS IN EFFECTIVE IA PROJECTS | Dan Brown, EightShapes
[Slides for presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/brownorama/crafting-the-discovery-phase-starting-design-projects-right "Crafting the Discovery Phase")

### Symptoms (of no or poor discovery phase)
1. Lack of alignment
2. Lack of definition
3. Lack of participation

### Discovery
> "A set of activities that yield shared knowledge to structure and inform design decisions about a particular product."
> (Talking about product design) "We're not creating the product, we're creating the vision"

[ Inputs and Relationships ] ----- Interpretation and Methods ---> [Product Design (the Desired/Actual Impact)
#### Activities and Outputs

##### Framing Problems
1. Problem
  - Captures the aspect of the world we're trying to change or improve
2. Objectives
  - Defines the project's desired outcome
3. Contextual Statements
  - Describe the ecosystem in which the product will live


##### Setting Direction
Sets the vision for all of us to get behind
1. Principles or implications
  - What the product should do
  - What makes it unique
  - What makes it better
  - What findings imply
2. Concepts
  - What's the big idea (the pitch)
3. Models
  - How the product looks and behaves

#### Discovery Matrix
[Use to discover the right methods/outputs to aid you at the appropriate time/purpose of the project](http://j.mp/discovery-matrix "Discovery Matrix")

### Needed for Discovery
#### The Mindset
- _Perceiving_ that you have gaps in knowledge
- _Understanding_ what's missing
- _Choosing_ to fill in that gap

#### The Attitude
- _Curious_ - You're excited to learn new things
- _Skeptical_ - You don't accept all assertions at face value.
- _Humble_ - You embrace your naivety and ignorance.

## Saturday Keynote on Accesssibility, Leonie Watson
> Accessibility is designing like you give a damn.

> No such thing as perfect accessibility...stick to the standards
